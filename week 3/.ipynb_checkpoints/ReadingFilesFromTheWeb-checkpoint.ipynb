    "A spreadsheet for instance can be transformed   into a list of lists: a spreadsheet is indeed a list of rows, and each row can be seen as a list of data-items. \n",
    "\n",
    "* in this representation we use the index-number of the column to get to the information in that column.\n",

      "Zo bewijs je Charlie Hebdo misschien wel de meeste eer,90863,Roy van de Ven,\"Bij al die marsen vraag ik me af of die mensen nu niet demonstreren voor het recht om te beledigen onder het mom van 'vrijheid van meningsuiting'. Ik denk niet dat we door steeds dezelfde beledigende cartoons af te drukken, tot een dialoog komen en zo worden de \"\"radicale Moslims\"\" alleen maar in de kaart gespeeld.\"\r\n",
      "Zo bewijs je Charlie Hebdo misschien wel de meeste eer,90841,Aksel de Vries,\"Deze column beangstigt me. Er wordt gesproken over eer bewijzen aan Charlie Hebdo. EÃ©n zin... en vervolgens trekt Rutger zijn eigen bivakmuts op, ratelt hij zijn eigen verhaal, beweert ie dat zijn visie de enige echte is en dat er niets anders belangrijker is dan zijn idealen, zelfs de moord op zijn collega-journalisten is irrelevant. Sorry, dat is geen eer bewijzen, dat is dansen op andermans graf.Als we eer willen bewijzen, laten we satirisch zijn, dan tekenen we een spotprent van Bregman met Kalashnikov... dansend op een kerkhof... strijdt niet voor de Islam, strijdt niet voor vrijheid van meningsuiting... we moeten strijden voor geitenwollen sokken voor elke wereldburger!!!Satire opent de geest, columns zoals deze veranderen mooie idealen in rigide denkbeelden. We willen niet nog meer debat cq. segregatie... we willen begrip over en weer. Ik (her)vertel graag over die wijze man of vrouw in Noord-Ierland, die op het hoogtepunt van de woede en het geweld, the troubles, op een kerkdeur schreef: /If we were born where they were born, and we were taught what they were taught, we would believe what they believe./ Een gouden inzicht.\"\r\n",
      "Zo bewijs je Charlie Hebdo misschien wel de meeste eer,90834,Wendy Van Ierschot ,\"Beste Rudger, dank voor je stuk. Ik worstel echt met de vraag wat er zo goed is aan het opzettelijk beledigen van anderen onder het mom van vrijheid van meningsuiting en 'ik mag alles zeggen wat ik wil'. Ik snap wel dat een juridisch systeem niet op te tuigen is om uit te zoeken wat precies beledigend is of niet. Dat zou zelfs kunnen leiden tot machtsmisbruik maar ik krijg bijna het idee alsof respect voor elkaar, elkaars beleefwerelden en dat niemand hier de waarheid in pacht heeft niets geen waarde meer heeft. Hoe kan dat nou voor een weldenkend mens? Waarom ben je voor de afschaffing van het verbod op haat zaaien? Wat voor iets moois of fijns brengt dat voor de kids die nu opgroeien?  Want wetten zijn er toch voor om de boel een beetje leefbaar te houden? Dit zijn geen retorische vragen. Ik heb echt het gevoel dat ik zo ongeveer de enige ben die me dat afvraagt dus help me alsjeblieft het te begrijpen. Dank je.\"\r\n",
      "Zo bewijs je Charlie Hebdo misschien wel de meeste eer,90872,Bas de Bakker,\"Beste Wendy, lees vooral het gelinkte stuk van Cas Mudde. En dan in het bijzonder het deel \"\"Second\"\". Ik hoop dat je het dan iets beter begrijpt.\"\r\n"
