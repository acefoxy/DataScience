1. TITLE: 
	SHUTTLE Dataset (StatLog Version)

2. USE IN STATLOG

	2.1- Testing Mode		
		Train and Test

	2.2- Special Preprocessing	
		Validation set:
		The examples in the original dataset were in time order,
		and this time order could presumably be relevant in classification.
   		However, this was not deemed relevant for StatLog purposes,
		so the order of the examples in the original dataset was randomised,
 		and a portion of the original dataset removed for validation purposes.

	2.3- Test Results

	Approximately 80% of the data belongs to class 1. Therefore the default 
	accuracy is about 80%. The aim here is to obtain an accuracy of 
	99 - 99.9%.        

	NUMBER OF ATTRIBUTES
		9

	The shuttle dataset contains 9 attributes all of which are numerical.
	The first one being time.
